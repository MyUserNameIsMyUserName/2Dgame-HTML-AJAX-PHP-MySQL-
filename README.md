basic 2D multiplayer
SUCH GAMEPLAY, MUCH MECHANICS, MANY GRAPHICS xD


Pressing buttons player moves.....JSON move enemies....moving mouse moves scope....also enemy too have that, yes. 

Custom collision detection and reporting which enemy has been shot.
Enemies have 4 dots in corners and they form 4 lines that are checked if they intesect with gun fire line. 
This is done for all enemies and will report using alert enemy name that has been hit.


Basic fog of war....hidding far enemies.

PS.
I love this kind of language...since I stumbled upon few clients that spoke it. 

Me good, you? yes :D
